// Package generator contains all codes about the Spec generator mechanism.
// It is a feature about kusionctl that can make Kusion more general in generating Spec and decoupled with KCLVM.
// Any generator implements the generator interface can be integrated in Kusion operation workflow.
//
// This mechanism is very meaningful to Kusion and makes the foundation to support other languages in the feature.
