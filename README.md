## What is Kusion?

Kusion is an intent-driven [Platform Orchestrator](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/platform-orchestrators/), which sits at the core of an [Internal Developer Platform (IDP)](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/). With Kusion you can enable app-centric development, your developers only need to write a single application specification - [AppConfiguration](https://www.kusionstack.io/docs/concepts/app-configuration). [AppConfiguration](https://www.kusionstack.io/docs/concepts/app-configuration) defines the workload and all resource dependencies without needing to supply environment-specific values, Kusion ensures it provides everything needed for the application to run.

Kusion helps app developers who are responsible for creating applications and the platform engineers responsible for maintaining the infrastructure the applications run on. These roles may overlap or align differently in your organization, but Kusion is intended to ease the workload for any practitioner responsible for either set of tasks.

## How does Kusion work?

As a Platform Orchestrator, Kusion enables you to address challenges often associated with Day 0 and Day 1. Both platform engineers and application engineers can benefit from Kusion.

There are two key workflows for Kusion:

1. **Day 0 - Set up the modules and workspaces:** Platform engineers create shared modules for deploying applications and their underlying infrastructure, and workspace definitions for target landing zone. These standardized, shared modules codify the requirements from stakeholders across the organization including security, compliance, and finance.

	Kusion modules abstract the complexity of underlying infrastructure tooling, enabling app developers to deploy their applications using a self-service model.

2. **Day 1 - Set up the application:** Application developers leverage the workspaces and modules created by the platform engineers to deploy applications and their supporting infrastructure. The platform team maintains the workspaces and modules, which allows application developers to focus on building applications using a repeatable process on standardized infrastructure.
