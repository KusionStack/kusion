# Kusion

Kusion is a cloud-native platform engineering engine from [KusionStack](https://github.com/KusionStack), designed to help you build an efficient and secure Internal Developer Platform (IDP). It enables application developers to complete all operational tasks in the DevOps lifecycle in one place, in a unified manner, without worrying about the complexity of the underlying infrastructure (Kubernetes, cloud platforms, and self-hosted services). It also offers a flexible Module extension mechanism for platform engineers, facilitating the abstraction, reuse, and standardization of foundational capabilities, thereby enabling self-service for application development.

## Key Features

- **Platform as Code**: Managing all application operations in one place, in a unified, easy way.
- **Dynamic Configuration Management**: Developers deploy to any environment using one environment-agnostic configuration, while Kusion handles the underlying complexity.
- **Enable Self-Service**: Developers fulfill their own needs by choosing the capabilities provided by the platform engineers in [Kusion Modules](https://www.kusionstack.io/docs/concepts/kusion-module/overview).
- **Built-in Security and Compliance**: Platform engineers standardize application deliveries with security, compliance, and best practices by flexible platform configurations.
- **Open Module Ecosystem**: A growing open module ecosystem covers all stages of the DevOps lifecycle, with extensive connections to various cloud-native infrastructures.
- **Lightweight and Kubernetes-friendly**: As a pure client-side solution with rich APIs, Kusion offers excellent portability and ease of integration. Meanwhile, user-friendly observability and troubleshooting capabilities make Kubernetes operations easier.
