  kusion deps --focus path/to/focus1 --focus path/to/focus2
  
  # List all the projects that depend on the given focus paths
  kusion deps --direct down --focus path/to/focus1 --focus path/to/focus2
  
  # List all the stacks that depend on the given focus paths
  kusion deps --direct down --focus path/to/focus1 --focus path/to/focus2 --only stack
  
  # List all the projects that depend on the given focus paths, ignoring some paths from entrance files in each stack
  kusion deps --direct down --focus path/to/focus1 --focus path/to/focus2 --ignore path/to/ignore
```
