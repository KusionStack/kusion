## kusion env

Print Kusion environment information

### Synopsis

Env prints Kusion environment information.

 By default env prints information as a shell script (on Windows, a batch file). If one or more variable names is given as arguments, env prints the value of each named variable on its own line.

 The --json flag prints the environment in JSON format instead of as a shell script.

 For more about environment variables, see "kusion env -h".

```
